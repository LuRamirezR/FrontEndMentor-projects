## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I discovered a property that I didn't know about to control the size of elements, such as text, and by using padding, I can make them look like buttons.
See the code snippet below:

```html
<p class="blog-button">Learning</p>
```
```css
.blog-button {
  width: max-content;
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to enhance my skills in Grid CSS and learn the React library.
