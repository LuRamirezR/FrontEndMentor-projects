## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

One of the key takeaways from this project was learning how to use Figma and apply the specified colors, fonts, and spacing from the design file. I used my understanding of HTML and CSS, particularly Flexbox, to successfully complete the project.

### Continued development

My goal is to learn the concepts required to develop a FrontEnd project and implement it using a framework such as Angular or React.
