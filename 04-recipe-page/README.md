### What I learned

In this challenge, I encountered some complexity as I was unsure how to change the color of the bullet/numeral to make it different from the text. However, I discovered how to use the pseudo-element ::marker to achieve this. Additionally, I also familiarized myself with the <hr> tag, which proved to be quite useful during the challenge. The most challenging part was adjusting the image so that it had a margin in the laptop view, while occupying all the space of the container in the mobile view.


### Useful resources

::marker
https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/CSS/::marker
- [<hr> documentation](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/html-horizontal-line-hr-tag-example/) - This helped me to learn how to apply the <hr> label 
- [::marker documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/CSS/::marker) - This helped me to learn how to apply the pseudo-element ::marker. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
